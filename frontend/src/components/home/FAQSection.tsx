      question: "How is Triksha different from other health wearables?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Triksha is not an ordinary tracking wearable deviceâ€”itâ€™s an AI-powered predictive health monitoring system. The wearable itself is designed to collect your 24/7 real-time health data accurately and comfortably. All the heavy AI analysis happens securely in our app and cloud, where advanced models analyze your data, medical history, and trends to predict potential health issues before they become serious. This ensures you get personalized, actionable health insights wherever you are.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {

      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are Triksha's health predictions?",
